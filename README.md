# ChartChecker: an automated tool to help enhance user awareness about misinformation in charts

This repository was created as part of a bachelor thesis by Niklas Knei√ül and is based on the work by Fan et al. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3502138).

This tool can be used to analyze charts for misleading visualisations. It displays which could be detected together with an explanation and contains an alternative, recommended that removes those visualisations. It can currently detect seven types of misleading features: Inconsistent axis scales, Inconsistent placement of tick labels, Inverted y-axis, Misleading aspect ratio, Missing labels, Mutiple Axis, Truncated y-axis.

The `source_code` directory contains an additional README including instructions on how to install and use this browser extension.
